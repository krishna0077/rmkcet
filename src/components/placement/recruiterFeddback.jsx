                        <p align="justify"> We have been recruiting from RMK group of institutions for the 5th year now only because of their Alumni performance at work. They are technically strong and getting stronger day by day without which they cannot sustain in a niche domain like us. They have shown tremendous performance not only at work but also in other areas like handling fresher interviews, fresher training, etc.  We take great pride in saying that our recruitment team to RMK this year had few of their alumni for the interview process who passes out in 2014, just three years before. <br /></p>
                        <p align="justify"> We generally hire only good problem solvers and solution givers.  RMK Alumni has proved the same throughout their tenure. They are all abreast with the technology that the company demands in no-time. Learning ability is good.  RMK Alumni exhibit extraordinary team work and leadership skills at work without which they couldn’t have become key members of our design team.  Innovation is integral part of Engineering and they have excelled in bringing innovative ideas for our products and projects.<br /></p>
                        <p align="justify"> Keep up the good work. Encourage students to do projects outside syllabus. Overall, we are very happy to get associated with RMK group of institutions and will continue to be associated.<br /></p>

                        <p align="justify"> Once we decided to put our daughter in engineering stream, we  unanimously decided RMKCET is the right place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After visiting the campus  and&nbsp;interacting with the faculty, we felt that the decision was 100%  right. Though she did her intermediate in the Tamil Nadu state board,  transition was made&nbsp;easy because standards were maintained  and&nbsp;students were given settlement time.<br /></p>
                        <p align="justify"> The Heads of Departments and the faculty members at RMKCET are  efficient, accommodative, approachable&nbsp;and accessible all the time.  Students are neither&nbsp;burdened nor unduly stressed out but at the  same&nbsp;time they are motivated and guided according to&nbsp;their potential  and capabilities. The personalized&nbsp;focus and attention due to high faculty  - student&nbsp;ratio help to leverage the students’ strengths&nbsp;and overcome  some of the challenges faced.<br /></p>
                        <p align="justify"> We sincerely appreciate the efforts of the management that provides  infrastructural facilities beyond the expectations of the affiliating and  approving bodies and ensures quality education along with catchy corporate  offers.&nbsp;I am proud to mention the delicious food and the safe transport  provided by the Management to everyone in the campus. Needless to mention the  diligent work executed by the Principal and Faculty of RMKCET and urge to keep  up&nbsp;the good work in shaping our Child's future.<br /></p>
                        <p align="justify"> I am happy that my daughter is in a safe haven that is going to  mould her not only into a corporate employee but also a responsible citizen who  will further the society with Engineering advancements.<br /></p>
                        <p align="justify"> We also take this opportunity to wish all the&nbsp;students of  RMKCET Good Luck and All the very best.&nbsp; <br /></p>
